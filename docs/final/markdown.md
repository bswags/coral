##Language Tutorial [tut]
Here we present five simple CORaL programs with the aim of introducing the reader to the core elements and components of CORaL. These will cover the basics of the CORaL language: working with variables and primitives, control flow, database integration and access, implementing simple database queries, and manipulation of files. Those well-versed in C should find working with CORaL functions to be completely familiar and intuitive, and we hope that the object-relational aspects of CORaL come equally naturally to those with previous exposure to databases and SQL, as well as those who have little-to-no experience with databases.   
### Getting Started With CORaL ###
As per tradition, the first program we present you with is the timeless “Hello, world.” Once you see these two words appear on your console, you’ve taken the first step towards unleashing the power of the CORaL language. Let this short program be your stepping stone to much greater things.  
The CORaL program to print “Hello, world” is shown below:

	void main()
	{
		printf("Hello, world\n");
	}
Now that we’ve written it, it’s time to compile and run it. CORaL programs are typically saved in files with the extension “.cl” and compiled with the command

	coralc hello.cl
This will produce as output an executable file named "hello.clx." If everything has proceeded as expected so far, after inputting the command

	./hello.clx
you will be greeted by the text

	Hello, world
And just like that, you're a CORaL programmer!
