CORaL
=====

Hey, welcome to version 1.0 of CORaL

Here's how it works:

1. Build and install the compiler:

    make install

2. The compiler is now installed in `/usr/local/bin` Run it like so:

    coralc path/to/program.cl

3. This outputs a program.clx executable. (Open up the source and you'll see some Python)

4. To execute, like C, do:

    ./program.clx
